# About Me

I’m currently a Master’s student in Quantum Science and Technology at TUM with a B.S. in Physics (optics concentration) and additional Mechanical Engineering background. Experienced in R&D engineering, optical system design, simulation, and experimental analysis. International research experience in Germany and Türkiye, with a strong foundation in laboratory work, programming, and data analysis.

Outside of academia, I enjoy Leage of Legends, calisthenics and my wife's company. As of 2025, I work as an Grocery Associate at Wolt Market to support my lifestyle.
